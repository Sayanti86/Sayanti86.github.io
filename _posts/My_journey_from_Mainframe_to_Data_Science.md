title: My journey from Mainframe to Data Science.
---

Prologue 
I am a data scientist in making with 9+ years of work experience in software industry . 
I chose to shift my career at its peak in my full senses , by choice and not by accident.
Though many of my well-wishers says , I have taken huge risk but I correct them stating , I have taken calculated risk .

The History
My career is born and brought up as mainframe developer . 
I started as Programmer Analyst Trainee in a Fortune 500 company in 2009 and steadily climbed the corporate ladder to 
become a Technical Lead of Mainframe projects.I worked in three different domains (Retail, Banking and Insurance ) and 
multiple projects in various roles. Starting as developer to designer to onsite coordinator and finally being project lead was 
not only challenging but also rewarding . However , with every passing day my scope of learning something new and doing 
something different in my field was narrowing down . It was in late 2016, I was 7+ years into software services industry , 
my career was almost stabilized and I could not see much growth out of it . 
Simultaneously , I developed keen interest on doing something beyond mainframes , something with bigger impact on society and 
something that makes my skill set industry independent .

The illusion.
My first , safe plan was to shift my career within company . 
I was under an impression that it will be easy to move within company given the number of years I am associated with the 
organization and the network that follows. 
I was aware that I had to be prepared with Python, Neural Network etc,  so I did self-study  , took online courses from eDx . 
However , soon I had my reality check when almost 6 to 7 projects rejected my resume , and none gave  even a chance for interview . 
The reason , was my long mainframe background and most importantly not having any formal education in data science . 

The Plan.
The rejections pushed me more towards taking  a concrete decision , and I decided to reskill myself to suit the data science industry . 
Instead of online courses I planned to take formal education in data science from foreign university . 
Hence , began the preparation to pursue Masters in Data Science . 
The first step , was to find list of colleges with course which I wish to take. 
I specifically chose all those universities with one year of course duration. It was just the tip of the ice berg . 
I chose few US universities and one Canadian University . 
Needless to say , that preparing for GRE , TOEFEL , IELTS while doing  my job was one of the most challenging part of my struggle.
However , there was one thing which was most challenging , even more than managing time ,
it was the patience and discipline to sit for studying after having 9 years of work experience . 
With each passing day , I became more and more focused and equipped to balance work and study which was only possible because of
immense support from my life partner , who not only short listed the details and deadlines of colleges but also became the reviewer 
of college essays and cameraman for my college videos. 
Finally , I managed to get acceptance from 4 US universities and 1 Canadian University. 

The Job .
When I was in my third year of under graduation , I got placed in the MNC , which I joined after completing my under grad in 2009 . 
That was my first and only company where I had worked for 9 years.
While preparing for my big career change I never thought it will be so difficult to leave the job where my growth was stagnant . 
Sometimes human mind has no rhythm , I was extremely happy and immensely sad at the same time when I quit my job …

The Choice . 
Though I started with the idea of studying in US , but given the political scenario I changed my plan and finally chose
the Canadian University – University Of British Columbia , Masters of Data Science . It is a 10-month accelerated professional masters ,
with Capstone project . This is specifically designed with Blocks of each month , which will have four subjects . 
Every subject will have assignments and quizzes in specific Blocks. Few of the subjects are like Python , R , Data Visualization, 
Supervised learning , Statistical Inference , Databases etc . 
My experience and under grad background in Information Technology helped me in few subjects like databases, 
programming but I had to work doubly hard for advanced maths , stats. 
MDS not only teaches data science subjects but also through its niche curriculum teaches the art of storytelling  
and art of questioning and analysis with the data in hand , which are the pillars of being a data scientist.

Life so far (End of Term 1) …
Amidst assignments , quizzes, lectures , deadlines, late night discussions all together it could have made my health worse 
if I had not been supported by my awesome peer groups. The rigorousness of the course does sometimes takes toll on peace of my mind , 
and most of the times in taste of my cooked food but it is the very intensity of the program which will prepare me for my future 
endeavors as data scientist. The program enhanced  my learning capability and upgraded my studying method . 
Not only the professors but also I am learning immensely from the versatile cohort .
My peer groups have always proved that learning is not a competition . 

Preparing for the first date …
Job interviews are like first dates, you can never predict the outcome. 
Here in MDS program we are not only taught subjects but also being prepared for our jobs interviews . 
The program helps develop profiles, connect with employers and train interview skills , resume building etc.
There are many career fairs , alumni meet ups and also capstone project which gives very good opportunities to meet employers. 
There are many employer info sessions and also other aids for getting to connect with employers . 

The beginning .
So far it has been a roller coaster ride which is life changing for most of us . 
When I look back to those days when I was struggling to shift my career from mainframe,
struggling to manage time between job and preparation , developing  the guts to take the leap of faith ; 
I get  an unexplainable confidence . The journey is so important than the destination that it gives me the courage and 
hope that I will someday bring change in society in some form and by choosing MDS ,
I have already taken the first few steps of the thousand miles .
